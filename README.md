Run SABnzbd rootless, lightweight and secure

# INTRODUCTION 📢

[SABnzbd](https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd) (created by [sabnzbd](https://github.com/sabnzbd)) is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python. It's totally free, easy to use, and works practically everywhere. SABnzbd makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an .nzb. SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction. SABnzbd offers an easy setup wizard and has self-analysis tools to verify your setup.

# MAIN TAGS 🏷️
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [4.5.3](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/sabnzbd/tags?name=4.5.3)
* [4.5.3-unraid](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/sabnzbd/tags?name=4.5.3-unraid)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is dangerous. Many times, I’ve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don’t want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:4.5.3``` you can use ```:4``` or ```:4.5```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!

# REGISTRIES ☁️
```
docker pull 11notes/sabnzbd:4.5.3
docker pull ghcr.io/11notes/sabnzbd:4.5.3
docker pull quay.io/11notes/sabnzbd:4.5.3
```

# UNRAID VERSION 🟠
This image supports unraid by default. Simply add **-unraid** to any tag and the image will run as 99:100 instead of 1000:1000 causing no issues on unraid. Enjoy.
